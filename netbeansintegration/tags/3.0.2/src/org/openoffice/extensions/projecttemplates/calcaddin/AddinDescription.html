        Creates a <b>Apache OpenOffice Calc Add-In</b> project.<br>
        Calc Add-Ins are specialized office extensions which extends <b>Apache OpenOffice</b> 
        functionality with new built-in <b>Calc Add-In</b> functions. These functions can be used directly 
        in the normal user interface of the Spreadsheet application in Apache OpenOffice.<br>
        A wizard collects information about new Calc Add-In functions and creates a new extended J2SE 
        class library project, generates <b>UNO IDL</b> files and generates a Java skeleton source file  
        implementing the new Add-In functions.
