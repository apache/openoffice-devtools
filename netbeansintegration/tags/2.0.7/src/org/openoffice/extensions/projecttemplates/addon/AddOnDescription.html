        Creates a <b>OpenOffice.org Add-On</b> project.<br>
        A <b>OpenOffice.org Add-On</b> is an external <b>UNO 
        component</b> providing one or more functions through the user interface
        of OpenOffice.org. A typical <b>Add-On</b> is available as a
        UNO package for easier deployment with the pkgchk tool. In addition to 
        an ordinary UNO package, an <b>Add-On</b> package contains configuration
        files which specify the user interface, registration for a protocol 
        schema, and first-time instantiation.
