        <h2>Apache OpenOffice UNO components</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>Apache OpenOffice UNO components provide functional enhancements for an existing 
        Apache OpenOffice office installation. UNO components can provide completely new
        functions for a specific functional area, or they can provide a new implementation for an existing set
        of services and interfaces. UNO components are the common way to extend the functionality of Apache OpenOffice.  
        Specialized wizards can simplify the work for specfic service provider interfaces. For example
        <a href="nbdocs:/org/openoffice/extensions/docs/overview-calc-addins.html">Calc Add-Ins</a> can be used to 
        add specialized financial calculation functions to Calc.
        </p>
        <p>UNO components can be realized in different ways and different programming languages (see the
        <a href="#seealso">references</a> below). The wizard is currently focused on Java technolgies. UNO components
        are realized as normal J2SE class libraries where one class is identified to be the entry point for the UNO
        component framework. This class provides information about newly implemented services, which are are like a 
        contract that new instances or objects for this service must fullfill. This means that it should not matter which 
        implementation you have for such a contract. All implementations should fullfill the contract according to the service
        specification. The registration class supports the necessary entry points to create new instances 
        for a specific implementation.<br>
        The generated component skeletons implement service specific interfaces as well as interfaces that the UNO
        framework requires.  All UNO components should implement these interfaces.
        <dl>
            <dt><b>XServiceInfo</b></dt>
            <dd>This interface provides information about the supported/implemented service.</dd>
            <dt><b>UNO component functions</b></dt>
            <dd>These two methods must be implemented by any UNO component, and they provide necessary information
            for the UNO component framework.<br>
            <b>__getComponentFactory</b> returns a component specific factory to create new instances of this component<br>
            <b>__writeRegistryServiceInfo</b> provides information about supported services and provides the relationship 
            between the implementation and the service that is used by the UNO framework to instantiate the right 
            implementation for this service.<br>
            To be able to have more than one sinbgle implementation of one (or more) services, there are sspecialized file 
            wizards to add service definitions and their implementations to the extension.

        <h3>Using Components in Apache OpenOffice</h3>
        <p>Once you have deployed a new UNO component in an Apache OpenOffice installation you can use it directly from any 
        other code or in macros. You can simply instantiate a new instance via the global service manager. If you have
        a new style service, you can call either the default constructor or a construcor defined in the 
        service definition in UNOIDL.</p>
        <p>For example:<br>
            <code>XMyType xMT = org.openoffice.MyType.create(xContext);</code>
        </p>
